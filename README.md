# Workday Planner

## Description

This application is a workday planner that allows you to save events for every hour of the workday. As the hours of the  The current date is displayed in the header using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/). The purpose of this assignment was to understand the concepts of event listeners and local storage, as well as integrating events for each timeblock that indicate whether the hour has passed. 

This project has been my hard lesson in the importance of not repeating myself. I eventually came to the conclusion while writing the JQuery portion (with the help of a learning assistant) that I would have to restructure my whole HTML in order to write efficient JQuery code. I definitely wondered this while I was writing my HTML. I think that next time, more thorough pseudocoding will help a lot.

## Installation

At present, this project is close to being deployed. Unfortunately, I haven't quite figured out why the code isn't storing to the local machine. Given more time, I would restructure the HTML so that I wouldn't have to add an event listener to each individual save button for every timeblock. I would also add a function that greyed out timeblocks to represent hours that have passed during the day.

## Navigation

To navigate this application, simply enter text into the corresponding text box of a timeblock and hit the "save" button to the right of the text box.
